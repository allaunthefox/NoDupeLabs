## Batching & Parallel Instrumentation

This project includes runtime knobs and lightweight instrumentation to improve and measure performance of parallel execution (reduce per-item process overhead) and to aid tuning.

- Environment variables (runtime knobs)
  - `NODUPE_BATCH_DIVISOR` — integer (default: 256). Used to compute batch_size = max(1, len(items) // (workers * batch_divisor)).
  - `NODUPE_CHUNK_FACTOR` — integer (default: 1024). Used to compute chunksize for map-based submissions.
  - `NODUPE_BATCH_LOG` — enable per-batch debug timing logs when set (e.g., `1`).

- Behavior summary
  - When using a process-based executor and batching is enabled, work is grouped into batches and a top-level batch worker processes lists of items to reduce pickling/IPC/scheduling overhead.
  - If computed batch_size <= 1 the implementation falls back to per-item map (with a computed chunksize).
  - The original public API surface is preserved; batching is a runtime coarsening strategy.

- Running the deterministic micro-benchmark (local tuning)
  - Example:

```bash
# run the micro-benchmark and print median timings
NODUPE_BATCH_DIVISOR=256 NODUPE_CHUNK_FACTOR=1024 pytest tests/core/test_parallel_microbenchmark.py -q -s
```

- Try varying knobs (e.g. `NODUPE_BATCH_DIVISOR=512`, `NODUPE_CHUNK_FACTOR=2048`) and compare medians to select production defaults.

- Artifacts and CI
  - Local instrumentation outputs and CI artifacts (pytest logs, coverage.xml) are stored in `output/ci_artifacts/`.
  - When opening a PR that includes batching changes, attach `output/ci_artifacts` to help reviewers reproduce performance comparisons.

- Tuning guidance
  - Run the micro-benchmark across a set of knob values on your CI-like environment and choose defaults minimizing the median runtime.
  - If CI enforces style/type checks, run formatters and linters before pushing tuned defaults.
